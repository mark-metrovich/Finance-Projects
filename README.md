# Projects for UCSB Dean's Investment Group Endowment
This is a collection of some projects that I created for the Dean's Investment Group at UC Santa Barbara. The group was made up of student portfolio managers who oversaw an endowment fund for the Economics Department at the school. We underwent Investment Analysis to make informed decisions for the fund under the advisory committee made of professionals in the industry as well as professors within the university. 

These projects are a mixture of my own creation with some source material which I will cite alongside the code. They are also a culmination of concepts learned in the classroom and translated to real applications in portfolio management and investment analysis.
