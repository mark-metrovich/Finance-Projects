# Finance-Projects
This is a collection of some personal projects I have worked on either for my undergraduate degree in Financial Math and Statistics from UCSB, or projects I have developed for the Endowment Fund I helped manage at UCSB. After my graduation I continued to study the application of mathematics and statistics to the world of finance.
